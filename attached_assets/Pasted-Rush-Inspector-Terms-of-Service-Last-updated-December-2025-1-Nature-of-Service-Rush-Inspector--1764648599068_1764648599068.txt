Rush Inspector – Terms of Service
Last updated: December 2025

1.  Nature of Service Rush Inspector operates exclusively as an online technology platform and referral/matching service. Rush Inspector does not perform home inspections, does not employ home inspectors, does not supervise home inspectors, and does not act as an agent or broker for any inspector. All home inspections are performed by independent third-party licensed professionals with whom you contract directly.

2.  24-Hour Inspector Match Guarantee Upon receipt of a properly completed request, Rush Inspector will immediately distribute the request to its network of independent licensed home inspectors and will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an acceptance within twenty-four (24) hours. If no inspector accepts the request within that period, the $349 matching fee will be waived in full and no charge will be made. This guarantee applies solely to the act of obtaining an acceptance and does not constitute a guarantee of any specific inspection date, time, report delivery, or inspection quality.

3.  Matching Fee and Refund Policy • A matching/coordination fee of three hundred forty-nine dollars ($349.00 USD) is charged to your payment method immediately upon an inspector accepting your request. • Once charged, the $349 fee is non-refundable except in the following two circumstances only: (a) the assigned inspector fails to appear at the scheduled inspection (no-show), or (b) the assigned inspector is found, prior to or at the time of inspection, to lack a current valid license or required insurance. • In either of the above cases, Rush Inspector will issue a full refund of the $349 fee within three (3) business days. • All other cancellations, changes of mind, transaction fall-throughs, or access issues result in forfeiture of the $349 fee.

4.  Payment to Inspector You are solely responsible for negotiating and paying the inspector’s inspection fee directly to the inspector. Rush Inspector has no involvement in, and assumes no liability for, that separate transaction.
